[12/02, 13:39] Babe 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨💞💞: I've always seen you from afar, like the Royal Prince we know from. So, it was that face I used to look at you with at first. And when I got closer, it wasn't a performance because you were fully into everything you were doing. Your mindset as president was really powerful to me. It's not easy to take on the weight of leading the whole school and kinda managing the affairs. I saw how you handled tough situations, and even when you were tired and needed a break, you pushed through for the sake of the students and your fellow executives. The way you balanced being president and having time for relationship was really admirable. Despite your busy schedule, you made time for what mattered - that was beautiful to see.
[12/02, 13:39] Babe 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨💞💞: "Your mindset hasn't shifted over the years. I've seen how you've done things in the past and how you still do things, and honestly, it hasn't changed much. Maybe some minor adjustments, but your core approach remains the same. You have this firm resolve - when you decide on something, you see it through as long as you believe it's right. You still have that spirit, and it's admirable."
[12/02, 13:39] Babe 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨💞💞: Comparing the you I met three years ago to the person I know now, I don't think your mindset has changed much. If I should point out one thing that's consistent, it's your leadership style. You don't let others dictate what you do. You have this mindset where, as long as you think you're doing what's right, nobody can change your mind. You don't let others' opinions affect your decisions. It's a trait that's both admirable and concerning, but it's definitely consistent – then and now.

"One thing that wowed me about your mindset was how straightforward you were when we first spoke officially. You knew what you wanted and went for it – telling me you were interested and wanted a relationship, even though we barely knew each other. You asked too deep questions and I can't even remember right now but made me really wonder. I loved that confidence although I thought you were lying 

And another thing that impressed me was how you made time for our relationship despite your busy schedule. Like that time you surprised me at my hostel with gifts and my favorite food – it was amazing! You always made sure to make up for lost time, whether it was waiting for you or catching up after a hectic day. That says a lot about your priorities and mindset."


chapter 2 testimonial

[12/02, 14:30] Royal Princess: Chapter2
I saw how you handled tough situations, and I was sometimes worried about you. Getting to know you closely, I saw how draining leadership can be – mentally and emotionally. You handled it well sometimes, and other times you let yourself process it. Like that time there was a light issue in school and everyone was criticizing you, and you literally broke down – you had a temperature, migraine, and I was really worried. It made me realize that leaders face a lot behind the scenes, and it's not easy. I'm glad you bounced back stronger and did well despite it all."
[12/02, 14:30] Royal Princess: "What I saw in you was resilience and a strong mind. The late nights, overthinking, and striving to make right decisions – it's not easy. I remember those nights we'd stay up late reading, preparing for busy days ahead. You'd push through exhaustion, driven by a desire to get things done. That's resilience, and it's something I really admire about you."
[12/02, 14:30] Royal Princess: "I loved how open you were about needing support. You'd ask for it when stressed, and that made it easy to be there for you. Like those times you'd say 'come over, I just need some company' or we'd go out because you'd had a long day – it showed me you're human, and that's okay. Not many men are that vulnerable, but you made it easy to support you."
[12/02, 15:07] Royal Princess: "Your partner has a big responsibility to the public, and they need your support – emotional, mental even monetary support if need be. I remember how i was there for my partner during tough times, like when there was a bad light issue when we were still in school. They need someone to be their rock, to encourage them, and to offer a shoulder to lean on. Sometimes, they'll make decisions you might not agree with, but understand that it's often for the greater good. Like that time my partner corrected me in front of others during a choir rehearsal– it wasn't easy, but it was necessary for the team's growth. Be their number one supporter, offer constructive feedback when needed, and trust that they're doing their best. That's the kind of support they need
[12/02, 15:08] Royal Princess: "One thing I wish people could see is how kind, sweet, and romantic you are – when you want to be actually. You're a complex mix of strength and softness, and it's something I really appreciate about you. And yeah, some things are just between us, right?"
