he will like to be addressed as  Jeremiah Alabi one of Unilorin Alumni who contributed money and he was my course mate in unilorin [12/02, 14:48] Alabi Agric: Honestly, asides the fact that you had served as the SU President which gives you the leverage as a voice for Unilorites, What majorly moved me to participate was the fact that I know you personally and if there was any question on your character I honestly wouldn't have joined in raising funds.
[12/02, 14:54] Alabi Agric: I know you for something, it's the fact that you are goal getter, this is what made 'Royal Prince" out of 'Joseph Ologundudu'. Goal getting definitely takes discipline. Going by the rigour of the Orientation Camp and your service as a Corps Camp Commandant, I knew then for sure that it took a lot of self-restraint and personal discipline to still lead the project and see to its successful completion.



Kofoworola testimonial 
[05/02, 20:44] Kofoworola Yea: 1. I felt motivated to join the project because I genuinely believed in the vision. I wanted to be part of something meaningful, especially seeing the alumni of Unilorin making an impact on NYSC. The result was proof that unity works
[05/02, 20:49] Kofoworola Yea: 2. One thing that stood out to me was the transparency, coordination, and strong teamwork between Corps members.
 I was impressed by how everyone trusted the process. Looking back, I realized it showed what people can achieve through cooperation, especially in achieving a shared goal
 Firstly, you were the former president of Unilorin
Then, you made a major role in leading the project. You coordinated everyone, motivated alumni to participate, and ensured the contributions were organized and impactful
