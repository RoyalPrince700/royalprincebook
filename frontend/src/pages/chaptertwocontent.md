# Chapter 2: Self-Leadership: The Foundation

> *"The first and greatest victory is to conquer yourself; to be conquered by yourself is of all things most shameful and vile."* — Plato

I have come to a profound realization that challenges the conventional view of authority: **leadership is not solely about leading other people; leadership is, first and foremost, about leading yourself.**

**Self-Mastery is the Peak:** Winning an Olympic gold or a war is nothing compared to getting your own mind and habits under control.

**The Ultimate Defeat:** Letting your impulses, laziness, or temper run the show isn't just a "fail"—in Plato's view, it's the most "shameful" way to live because it means you've lost your freedom to your own shadows.

If you get this fundamental truth right, you will fully comprehend the essence of true leadership. I have searched through history and observed contemporaries, and I have found this to be an absolute law: there is no great leader of others who cannot first lead himself. It is impossible. While someone might stumble into a position of authority unconsciously, sustained greatness requires the capacity for self-mastery.

Why is this? Because the people you intend to lead are watching. They are not just listening to your words; they are studying your life. They are asking silent questions: *Is this person disciplined? Is he committed? Is he result-oriented?*

Before you can direct the lives of multitudes, you must answer a simple question: **Are you capable of directing your own life?**

## The Lost Cannot Lead

Leading from within is not a new concept; it is the ancient prerequisite for influence. Picture it this way: imagine someone is lost in a dense forest, disoriented and panic-stricken. Then, they meet another person who is equally lost.

Can the second person help the first? No. A man who is lost cannot help another find his way.

For a leader to be a guide, he must first have navigated the path himself. He must have found his direction. Only after he has worked that path—struggled with it, understood it, and mastered it—can he turn back and say to others, "Follow me, I know the way."

This is the essence of leadership. It is easier to bring others along a path you have already walked. You must first discipline yourself and commit to the task. Leadership must be result-oriented, and the first result you must show is the command you have over your own actions.

## Leadership by Example: The Hunger Test

One of the most powerful forms of leadership is **Exemplary Leadership**—leadership by example. It is the concept that you do not ask your team to do what you are not willing to do yourself.

I remember a specific incident with one of the teams I lead. We were holding a program, and it became apparent that the food provided was not enough for everyone. I had already received my share, and so had many others. But then we realized that one crucial team member had been overlooked.

This person was vital to the team. He had spent his own money and time traveling all the way from Lagos to Ibadan just to be there. And now, after all that sacrifice, I was being told there was no food for him?

I was angry. How could we miss this? But anger is not leadership; action is.

I immediately brought out my food and said, "Give my food to him."

People around me protested. "No, we won't allow you to do that. You are the leader."

I insisted. "Okay, if you won't allow me to give it all, take half of my food."

The moment I made that move—the moment I showed I was willing to go hungry for the sake of my team member—the atmosphere shifted. Other people started donating their food. "Take mine," "Take some of mine." Before we knew it, we had more than enough food for him.

What is the lesson here? As the leader, I spearheaded the solution. I didn't just issue a command: "Go and find food for him." I didn't delegate the problem. I took a bold step. I sacrificed. When others saw that the leader was willing to pay the price, they said, "Oh, let's follow this person."

## The Ripple Effect of Initiative

This principle of "going first" became a habit for me. I realized that people are often waiting for permission to be generous or helpful, and the leader's action gives them that permission.

During my time as a student, and later as Student Union President at the University of Ilorin, I saw this play out repeatedly.

I recall an exam period when I was still a Faculty Librarian in my 300 level. Exam periods are notoriously difficult for students; many are broke and struggling to afford basic meals. Someone reached out to me saying they needed food.

I didn't have much, but I had a platform. I posted on my status that there were students in need and that I was willing to donate a certain amount of food to start the drive.

Immediately, the response was electric. Because I had volunteered first, another person said, "Oh, I'm interested in donating too." Then another. And another. We raised enough money to buy bags of rice, packs of spaghetti, and various foodstuffs. We ended up feeding a lot of students that season.

Later, as Student Union President, a similar situation occurred. Engineering students reached out on Twitter; some needed scientific calculators, others needed food. I publicly volunteered to buy some calculators and support with food.

Before I knew it, other student leaders and students were replying under the tweet, "I'll support with one calculator," "I'll send this amount." What started as a casual interaction snowballed into a massive community support system.

Why? **Because I volunteered.**

You must be the one to make the move. You cannot put the responsibility on others until you have placed it squarely on yourself. That is self-leadership.

This standard of self-leadership—of doing the work before asking others to do it—transforms those around you. Phoenix, who is now the Student Union Senate President, reflects on how this demanding style of self-leadership influenced his own work ethic when he worked with me:

> *"The tasks were getting too much at a point... But here's the drill: Royal Prince gives a task—'I need you to set 50 questions, take a class, summarize with deadlines!' He didn't compel me to do it; I wanted to. Meeting deadlines became the baseline; I don't procrastinate. I learned from Royal Prince to stop when I am done, not when I am tired. That habit of getting things done has rubbed off on all spheres of my life."*

When you lead yourself relentlessly, you give those around you a blueprint for their own excellence.

## Skin in the Game: The Financial Commitment

The ultimate test of this self-leadership often comes down to finances. It is easy to pledge support; it is harder to pledge your own money.

I made it a rule: whenever my team or organization needed to raise money for a project, I would be the first to contribute.

I remember when I was the Director for one of my organizations. We needed to buy equipment that cost about 60,000 Naira. In a room full of people, the silence can be deafening when a figure like that is mentioned.

I broke the silence. "I am dropping this specific amount," I said, mentioning a significant portion.

The dynamic changed instantly. Everyone looked at me, saw the seriousness, and started chipping in. We raised the complete sum that very day.

This strategy proved itself again during my NYSC (National Youth Service Corps) at the Iseyin camp. The University of Ilorin alumni were known for making contributions, and at that time, a hall was being built for the camp. I looked at the project and told my fellow alumni, "This project is big. Our population here is large. We must do something."

I set a target: 100,000 Naira.

I gathered a few friends and told them the vision. But I didn't just sell the vision; I sold my commitment. "We are going to contribute at least 100,000 Naira," I said, "and **I am dropping 20,000 Naira instantly.**"

I sent the money immediately.

That action made the vision visible. It made it realistic. If I had just said, "Hey everyone, let's start contributing," without defining my own stake, doubt would have crept in. They would have wondered if the goal was achievable. But because I took the first step, they believed.

"I will send 5,000," one said. "I will send 1,000," said another.

By the end of the day, we had raised 109,000 Naira—surpassing our target.

Jeremiah Alabi, a fellow alumnus who participated in that contribution, later shared why he joined in:

> *"What majorly moved me to participate was the fact that I know you personally... I know you for something, it's the fact that you are a goal getter... I knew then for sure that it took a lot of self-restraint and personal discipline to still lead the project and see to its successful completion."*

Kofoworola, another team member on the project, echoed this sentiment:

> *"I felt motivated to join the project because I genuinely believed in the vision... You coordinated everyone, motivated alumni to participate, and ensured the contributions were organized and impactful."*

Trust is the currency of leadership, and self-leadership is how you earn it. When people see you have "skin in the game," their hesitation turns into action.

## The Resilience of Self-Leadership

However, self-leadership is not just about strength and public victories. It is also about what happens behind closed doors. It is about resilience when things go wrong.

Leadership can be draining. There will be times when the weight of expectation feels heavy, when the "light goes out" literally and metaphorically.

My partner, Oladipo Favour, who saw the behind-the-scenes reality of my tenure, describes this hidden side of self-leadership:

> *"I saw how you handled tough situations... Getting to know you closely, I saw how draining leadership can be – mentally and emotionally. Like that time there was a light issue in school and everyone was criticizing you, and you literally broke down... But I'm glad you bounced back stronger... What I saw in you was resilience and a strong mind. The late nights, overthinking, and striving to make right decisions... You'd push through exhaustion, driven by a desire to get things done."*

Self-leadership doesn't mean you are immune to stress or failure. It means you have the resolve to bounce back. It means that even when you break down, you don't stay down. You process the pain, you rest if you must, but you eventually stand up and continue the work.

## Conclusion

The concept of self-leadership is synonymous with exemplary leadership. Regardless of the position you hold, if you want your team, your members, or your organization to do something, **start it first.**

You cannot ask for sacrifice if you are living in comfort. You cannot ask for generosity if you are tight-fisted. You cannot ask for discipline if you are chaotic.

When you lead yourself, you make the vision believable for others. You show them that the destination is reachable because you are already walking towards it.

Leadership is not a title you wear; it is an action you take. And that action must always begin with you.

### 🚀 Action Points

1.  **The "First Mover" Audit:** Identify one area in your team, family, or business where things are stagnant. Ask yourself: "Have I taken the first step here?" If people aren't speaking up in meetings, are you speaking up? If people aren't punctual, are you early? Identify one action you can take *first* this week to break the deadlock.
2.  **Visual Commitment:** The next time you need to rally people for a cause (a project, a donation, a trip), do not just announce the plan. Announce your contribution *simultaneously*. Make your "skin in the game" visible to those you lead.
3.  **Self-Correction Reflection:** At the end of each day this week, look in the mirror and ask: "If everyone on my team acted exactly like I did today, would we have succeeded or failed?" This is the ultimate test of self-leadership.
