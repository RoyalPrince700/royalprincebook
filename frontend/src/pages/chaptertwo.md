"Chapter Two: Self Leadership - The Foundation

Why leading yourself is paramount to leading others. The focus of this book is firstly about self leadership.

I have come to realize that leadership is not solely on leading other people... leadership is first leading yourself. Get this right and you will understand and fully comprehend what leadership is.

I have searched... there is no great leader, there is no great leader leading others who can't lead himself. You can't... this might happen unconsciously, but when you check... most great leaders have the capacity to lead themselves.

Because leadership... that people think that it is about you leading others... is that those other people that a leader will lead must see that this person is truly a leader... by looking at his life... they can see that this man can lead himself, this man is disciplined, this man is committed, this man has results, is result-oriented."

How's that? Want me to refine it or move on? 😊

"Leadership must start from within... leadership is first about yourself.

Are you capable enough to direct your life before you start leading multiple people? Before you start leading multitudes, you must first be able to lead yourself.

Are you disciplined enough? Are you committed enough? The result you want to see in others, is it evident in your own life?

You are occupying a position... the people you are leading will first look at your life. When you say something, people first look at it... "Has this person even done it?"

Which is what is called leadership by example... which is one of the best form of leadership... exemplary leadership."

"Leading from within is not a new concept... leading from within has been right from the beginning. Everybody must first be able to direct their path... you must come to the point whereby you have a direction for yourself.

A man who is lost cannot help another person find its way. Picture it like this... someone is lost in a particular location, then that person met another person that is lost... a person that is lost cannot help the other person because he himself can't find his way. How will he help another person?

And this means that for him to help another person that is lost, he must first find his way. After he has navigated and found his way, that is when he can put other people through that same path... now he has worked that path, it is easier for such a man to bring others to work in that path... and that is leadership.

You must have first been able to discipline yourself, to commit to a task... because leadership must be result-oriented. You are leading other people to a point in which people can see the result...

You are holding a position... for instance, you are president of an organization, you are the leader of a team, you are a leader in different aspect of your organization... your team, you must be able to have a vision and a goal, you and your team are working towards to achieve that goal... you must be able to carry everybody along, share the vision with them, bring execution plan and see through it that the plan is executed."

"When you see people supporting a man's vision, if you look at it critically, it started from that man pushing and pushing his vision.

For instance, I remember in one of the teams I am leading... we had a program and I think food was not enough. I've received my food and other people too have received their food... so one of the things that happened was that this person is important to the team...

I was angry... how did they miss this person? After so much... this person spent his money, spent his time travelling down all the way from Lagos to Ibadan... and then you are telling me that this person did not get food?

So the next thing I did is that I brought out my food... I said they should give my food to this person... and then people asked me... said no, we are not going to allow you to do that.

Okay, I said okay... if you will not allow me, take half from my food... then other people started donating their food... and before we know it, we have more than enough food.

But one thing you must learn is that as the leader, I spearheaded the movement... I spearheaded the solution... I didn't just say that go and get him food... I did not say that look for food for him... no, I took a bold step... I donated mine... other sees that and they said oh, let's follow this person."

"I remember one important event that happened... someone reached out to me, it was during exam period. I think I was just a faculty librarian then, when I was in 300 level.

So the person reached out to me that oh, they need food... like exam period is always the period whereby people don't have much money.

So they reached out to me that they needed food. All I did was that I supported this person with food. So I just posted it on my status that oh, I have few people that needed food... and then I have donated or I am willing to give this amount of food, however we need more...

Another person said oh, they will be interested in donating this food, if the person is interested... other people started turning up... to the point whereby I was able to raise enough money that we... I had to buy a bag of rice, I bought packs of spaghetti and different food stuff... and I started sharing to a lot of students.

The result was... because it started from myself volunteering to do the task first... I didn't just say oh please we need some work... no, I supported first, it started from me."

"Similar experiences happened and I've made it something like I do it every time. When exam is closed... while I was president... a similar event happened while I was student union president, University of Ilorin.

A similar experience happened whereby on my social media account on Twitter, some student needed some help and I volunteered to help them... I think engineering students... some of them needed scientific calculators, yes... some needed food.

And what I did was that I volunteered to buy some calculators online... on my Twitter platform... before I know it, other leaders started supporting students under the tweet... and then what was supposed to just become a mere or a casual interaction spread so big among the student community... why? Because I volunteered.

That is it... you must first be the one to make the move... you must first lead by example... that is called self leadership... you are not putting the responsibility first on others... you are putting it on yourself... you are putting the responsibility first on yourself... when people see that this person is making move, is taking an action... other people will be prompted or willing to do more."

"The concept of self leadership is exemplary leadership... regardless of the position you find yourself, anything you want your team, your members, your organization to do... start it first.

You want to raise an amount of money for a project... volunteer to be the first to drop money. Anytime we want to raise money in my team, in my social... I'm the first person to volunteer to drop the money.

If for instance... I was the ND of one of my organization... and then we wanted to buy an equipment to help us in the organization... and then we checked the price and the price was about... let's say sixty thousand naira.

It was about sixty thousand naira and I said to myself... I said I'm dropping this amount... and I said I'm dropping this amount... everybody looked... I said okay, we are going to support... everybody started supporting... everybody started supporting... and before we know it, that day we raised the money completely... we raised the money completely."

"I remember when I went to Iseng camp... during my NYSC, University of Ilorin was known for a remarkable contribution... as of then, they were building the hall for Iseng camp whereby NYSC students are going to be having their programs... the hall was almost completed.

And I said, this project is big... as alumni of University of Ilorin, what am I going to do? What can we do? Because our population is also quiet much at Iseng camp...

And I said to myself, I will speak to as many University of Ilorin students that we have... and they were going to contribute a particular amount of money.

So I said to myself that okay, our target is one hundred thousand naira... let's use it to support what they are doing... and I said what can I do first?

I gather few of my friends together at Iseng camp... and I said we are going to be contributing at least one hundred thousand naira... but I am going to be dropping twenty thousand naira instantly...

Everybody believed in the vision because I made it possible... I made it visible, I made it realistic... because I was able to convince them that I believed in the vision... I'm telling them by taking the first step.

If I had just said that eh, everybody let's start contributing... I don't know how much I'm also going to drop... and all of those... that it will discourage them... but because I made the first move... I contributed... I told everybody I'm dropping twenty thousand naira... and I sent the money to the person we are assigned to be collecting the money... immediately I sent it, every other person started turning up... I will send five thousand naira... and that person one thousand naira... and that person... before we know it, at the end of that day we were able to raise I think one hundred and nine thousand... because we raised more than hundred thousand... everybody saw that we are doing this thing because I made it possible and visible for them."
