[06/02, 05:47] ⭐Phoenix ⭐: 1. "You need to be different perspective"
Tbvh as at that time I didn't necessarily have a meaning to it, you saw well into the Future than I did, I have always been different and exceptional but coming into unilorin wasn't to become different because I was not happy with studying Agric as at the point of entry with a 250 Jamb score, what you successfully did was first shifting my paradigm to understanding that there's more and that's where I caught the spark first.
When you approached me to be different I only saw an avenue to do better, I was willing to learn because I knew I was in  a new environment and it would take one who understood it well to help me b
Navigate it well.
Seeing my potential, when I started tutoring, initially when you challenged me to I saw it as a big task & not achievable , after the first case I was like so I could do this? 
And boom I knew there's more.
[06/02, 05:47] ⭐Phoenix ⭐: 2. Seems I have answered this question with one I'll do more here then.
Vision? Get in - Get out!
Do the little I can, I have always had compassion, so maybe help a few 100's and graduate with a second class, my plan was to play very well and enjoy university life don't blame me.

When I started working with you, the task, the accountability I was placed under, the training, the multitasking, the need to carry yourself as exceptional not in acts alone but in character, modesty even on appearance on social media, I saw it and said this is good. I had to sit down, tore the book of play and say I was going to make  a positive influence on this campus.
[06/02, 05:47] ⭐Phoenix ⭐: 3. I didn't step into politics early and anytime I thought about this in 300lvl I am scared of my own vision, are you sure you'd get here, if you do will you do well, do you think you have the capacity to do this, I will say I am not doing again when I see a few things that happened with the then student leaders. When you emerged as the Su President that was when I now sat down and say at all cost I must get here and God must help me. You'd discover u started asking a lot of questions then, I was trying to pull together my inferences analyze and make something out of it, it's more like the similitude of greatness emanated from close followership I just knew I couldn't settle for less, if you had done well, God will help me to do much more.

1. This was one Godamn issue back then 🤣 the task were getting too much at a point I'll look and say Royal just wanna get the job done he doesn't care what I am going through? 🤣 Yeah don't blame me tho, I was using pop 2 yea a phone that was handed over to me by my deceased mum, the phone was lagging, I barely survived on campus those days, it's just 1k I must manage for a week, most times the thought alone drains me.
But here's the drill, Royal prince gives task I need you to set 50 questions,... Take a class, summarize kinikan with deadlines! First was, you didn't compel me to do, I wanted to, I could said no when you approached and boom we just keep ourselves at arms length.
ii. Sincerely i was happy with what I was doing, and I know in the long run Royal prince is trying to help students and I am a part of it, that alone is enough to keep me going.

Finally, there's one ideology I keep, I am a man of my words, since there's deadline I'll rather do 45 or 50 tasks and submit at the time you asked rather than not submit at all.🥹
Yes some days I do more than required, but that's where the discipline set in, my friends will be like are you collecting money for this thing? But it was beyond that, over time as it continued it built my discipline and confidence more.
[06/02, 05:47] ⭐Phoenix ⭐: 2. Seems I have answered this together with one too.
Meeting deadline, the base line of it is that I don't procrastinate and people take it for I don't rest and I learnt from you to stop when I am done not when I am tired.
That habit of getting it done runs off on all the spheres of my life not even campus life alone and it's from you.
[06/02, 05:47] ⭐Phoenix ⭐: 3. Yes I saw it, I really saw it managing PR's back then, coordinated trending, Vice-president of the mentorship, pro of the foundation amongst others, I looked at it and said I didn't qualify (although based on merit the body trusted me with it) for this yet with proper guidance I did well. 
Now as the Senate President, I list my to-do list for the week, daily tick them done, handling 16 faculty, 9 hall of residence, committee harmonization, close door meetings with the university management, all these I could manage effectively from what I have gathered over time.

I want to link a scenario and how I handled it, while working for you we don't start preparing for what we need when we need it, we start weeks before we need them, say Graphics, content e.t.c.
It has really rubbed off that I make sure we start preparing for everything we  need in the month from the month and you hear things like SP we don't need it yet, let us do it 3days to, rara oo, do it now if there's error or adjustment(s) we can make before the said date.

This is how far we have come.
[06/02, 05:47] ⭐Phoenix ⭐: Once again sir, thank you for taking time to mold me and sharpen my perspective, like at home they had to be asking who is this royal prince!😂
