# Chapter 1: The Mindset Shift

> *"The greatest discovery of my generation is that a human being can alter his life by altering his attitudes."* — William James

I became the 36th Student Union President of the University of Ilorin, leading a student body of over 40,000 individuals. Prior to that peak, I served as the Student Union General Secretary in my third year. In my second year, I was the Librarian for the Faculty of Agriculture, representing over 5,000 students. Even as a freshman in 100 level, I served as an Honourable Representative for my department.

To an outside observer, my leadership journey might look like a perfectly calculated ascent through the university ranks—a straight line of victories. But looking back, I know the truth. My leadership journey didn't start with an election victory. It didn't start when I arrived on campus. It didn't start with a title.

It started years earlier, in a single room I shared with my mother and sister, with a quiet but radical decision to be different.

## The Origin of Hunger

I did not come from a wealthy background. At the time my journey began, my mother was earning about forty to forty-five thousand Naira a month. That was our reality. We lived in a single room, and resources were so tight that my admission to the university had to be delayed; the family needed my elder sister to graduate before they could afford to send me.

I remember sitting at home after secondary school, stuck in that waiting period. I looked at our situation—the limitations, the struggle—and I knew with absolute clarity: **I cannot continue like this.**

In church, I saw families who were comfortable. I saw people living the kind of life I wished we had. At sixteen or seventeen, my definition of success was simple and material: I wanted to build my own house. I wanted to drive my own car. I wanted to live well. It was a limited view, shaped by my lack of exposure, but it was a powerful fuel.

I told myself, *"I have to do all it takes to be successful."*

That phrase became the bedrock of my existence. I realized that because of my background, I didn't have the luxury of chance. If I wanted a different life, *I* had to be different. It wouldn't be handed to me on a platter of gold.

## The Awakening: Leading Yourself First

Many people assume leadership is about directing others—standing in front of a crowd and giving orders. They neglect the foundational truth that **true leadership begins with leading yourself.**

Before I could lead 40,000 students, I had to learn to lead one person: myself.

This self-leadership started with a shift in mindset. I began to picture a future that didn't exist yet. I didn't know the "how," but I knew the "what." I constantly affirmed to myself that my future would be bright. This wasn't just wishful thinking; it was a mental restructuring. I was training my mind to see possibilities where others saw dead ends.

My close friend and former roommate, Adeyemi Favour, recalls this period vividly:

> *"One of the most defining aspects of Royal’s life is that he acts like the person he wants to become... If Royal aspired to become a president, for example, he would begin painting the picture for us—how he would walk, the kind of clothes he would wear, the people he would meet, and the rooms he would enter... He spoke first, acted next, and followed through relentlessly."*

I wasn't just dreaming; I was rehearsing. I was living in the future I wanted to create before it arrived.

### The Spoken Word Challenge

One of the most critical moments in this transformation happened when I was scrolling online and saw a flyer for a talent competition. It promised a cash prize for singing, dancing, or spoken word poetry.

I had never faced an audience in my life. I had never written a poem to perform. I had never spoken publicly. But I saw that flyer, and something in me clicked.

I said to myself, *"I can do spoken words. Let me give this a trial."*

The competition was massive, drawing participants from major cities like Lagos, Ibadan, and Akure. And there I was, in my small town, telling myself I could compete with them.

I went for the competition. The result? I didn't even pass the audition stage.

But here is the lesson: the victory wasn't in the prize money. The victory was in the audacity of the attempt. The moment I said, *"I can go, I can do this,"* something shifted. That thought pushed me to step out of my comfort zone. I realized that once I made up my mind to do something, my body and actions would align to make it happen. I had proven to myself that I could take action.

## The Discipline of Passion

This new mindset—this hunger for success—began to bleed into everything I did. I decided that if I was going to be successful, I had to put my entire being into whatever task was in front of me, no matter how small.

I started attending a new church and noticed they didn't have a conga drummer. I had played in my former church—played so well that people would put money in my pockets and celebrate me. So, I volunteered.

I didn't just play; I attacked the drums. I played with such energy and strength that my hands would literally swell after the service. I played as if my life depended on it.

People in the church started asking, *"Who is this new boy playing so passionately?"*

I wasn't playing for the applause. I was practicing success. I started going to the church every day, Monday to Friday, just to practice. I believed that this discipline, this consistency, and this passion were the raw ingredients of the success I craved. I was building the muscles of a leader before I had a team to lead.

This disciplined approach to growth didn't just affect my skills; it shifted the perspectives of those around me. Another close associate, Phoenix, who is now the Student Union Senate President of the University of Ilorin, shared how this mindset impacted him when we first met:

> *"When you approached me to be different, I only saw an avenue to do better... Seeing my potential, when I started tutoring, initially when you challenged me to, I saw it as a big task and not achievable. After the first case, I was like, 'So I could do this?' And boom, I knew there was more... I had to sit down, tear the book of play, and say I was going to make a positive influence on this campus."*

Leadership, I learned, is contagious. When you lead yourself with excellence, you implicitly challenge everyone around you to rise to your level.

## The Blueprint: Exposure and Preparation

This drive followed me as I prepared for university. While waiting for my admission, I stayed with my elder sister who was a student at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB).

This period was my training ground. My sister was a Class Representative, and she would come home and share stories of her responsibilities. I admired that. I thought, *"I want to hold that kind of position."*

Then, a friend of hers contested for Faculty President. I watched the drama unfold from the sidelines—the campaigns, the rallies, the political maneuvering, the petitions, and the disqualifications. It was intense, and to many, it might have been discouraging. But to me? It was fascinating.

I told myself, *"When I gain admission, I'm going to do this. I'm going to go into student politics."*

By the time I eventually entered the University of Ilorin, I wasn't just a confused freshman. I was a young man with a plan. My mind was already prepared. I had seen the landscape. I had built the discipline. I had cultivated the hunger.

This preparation didn't just affect me; it created a ripple effect. As my roommate Adeyemi noted:

> *"Living around Royal’s leadership pushed both Johnson and me into leadership roles ourselves. In my 400-level days, I became the class representative, while Johnson became the General Secretary of his department. His excellence in leadership rubbed off on us naturally... Being around him made leadership feel normal, attainable, and expected."*

My girlfriend, Oladipo Favour, who has witnessed my journey from that early ambition to my presidency, reflects on how this foundational mindset has remained a constant force, not just in politics, but in our personal lives:

> *"One thing that wowed me about your mindset was how straightforward you were... You knew what you wanted and went for it. And another thing that impressed me was how you made time for our relationship despite your busy schedule... That says a lot about your priorities and mindset. You have this mindset where, as long as you think you're doing what's right, nobody can change your mind... It's definitely consistent – then and now."*

This consistency—whether in pursuing a position or a partner—is the hallmark of self-leadership. It means knowing what you want, going for it without hesitation, and making the time to nurture it.

## Conclusion: Mindset Over Discipline

My success as a Student Union President was not an accident. It was the result of a mindset that had been cultivated years prior in a single room with a struggling mother.

Many believe that discipline is the first step to leadership, but I disagree. **Leadership starts with mindset.**

Discipline is the engine, but mindset is the steering wheel. You can be disciplined about the wrong things, or disciplined without direction. But when your mindset shifts—when you truly *believe* you are capable of more, when you *see* yourself as a leader before anyone else does—discipline becomes a natural byproduct.

I didn't start practicing the drums every day because I forced myself to be disciplined; I did it because my mindset had shifted to one of excellence. I didn't step into student politics because I wanted a title; I did it because my mind had already accepted the responsibility of leadership.

If you take nothing else from this chapter, take this: **No man who cannot put his own mind in order can put the lives of others in order.**

It starts with the thought. It starts with the belief. It starts with the decision to be different.

If you want to lead, you must first answer the call to change your mind.

### 🚀 Action Points

1.  **Define Your Success:** Take a moment to write down what "success" looks like to you right now. Be honest. Is it material? Is it impact? There is no wrong answer, but you must have a target.
2.  **Identify Your "Conga Drum":** What is one small thing you are currently doing—a job, a chore, a class—that you can choose to do with "presidential" passion this week? Commit to doing it with excellence, not for the reward, but for the discipline.
3.  **The Mindset Check:** Close your eyes and picture the future you want. Do you truly believe it is possible? If you don't believe it, you cannot build it. Spend five minutes today visualizing your future self.
