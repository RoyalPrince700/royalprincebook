using the ai writing guidline file, chapter one content I became the 36th Student Union President while on campus, which is one of the highest leadership positions I've held. Prior to that, in my 300 level, I became the Student Union General Secretary. While in 200 level, I became the Librarian of my faculty, Faculty of Agriculture, with over 5,000 students. Oh, that reminds me, the University of Ellore has over 40,000 students at large.

So, I was president of over 40,000 students, General Secretary of over 40,000 students, Faculty Librarian for over 5,000 students

In 100 level, I became an Honourable Representative for my level, representing the Department of Agriculture.

My leadership journey didn't start with me becoming the Student Union President. Thinking back, it started when I decided I wanted to be successful - far before I gained admission. Even before writing JAMB, before gaining admission... I asked myself what I wanted to become.. It wasn't when I got to the university that I felt I could lead. No, it started way before then. It started when I sat down and said to myself, 'I have to do all it takes to be successful.' I started telling myself what I needed to do to get the kind of life I wanted.

This was even way before I entered university. Yes, I knew that by the time I got to university, I wanted to do a lot of things - start organizations, register clubs on campus, do business, do student politics... I wanted to do so many things.

But before I entered campus, way before I knew I was going to University of Ellore, I said to myself I must be different. And I discovered that this mindset started shaping my leadership journey, started making me think like someone who knows what they want to do. When I said to myself 'I have to do all it takes to be successful', I was young and didn't have much exposure, and I'm not from a rich background. My mum was earning about forty to forty-five thousand naira at that time. We were living in a single room - myself, my mom, and my sister.

To me, being successful meant having my own house, fine houses, beautiful houses, having cars, living well - that's what I thought success was based on my exposure.

Because of the background I had, my mom had to take care of myself and my sister with the little she was earning. My academics to university were delayed because my sister had to graduate before I could gain admission.

I was at home after secondary school, and I knew I couldn't continue like that. I knew something had to happen. I had to be successful. I had to take my family out of the situation we were in.

In my church, I saw people from rich backgrounds... I wished my family was like theirs. What was going through my mind every time was - I know I have to do something. I didn't really know much about what to do, but I knew strongly within me that something had to change. Something in me had to change. Because of my background, I knew I had to be different if I wanted to be successful. With the little knowledge I had, I had this strong feeling... I'm from a faith background, I'm a Christian. We go to church and have faith that things will get better.

I also had this strong feeling that I must be successful. One thing at the back of my mind was that there is a future, and when that future comes, things get better. I'm sure I learned this from movies and stories of people from poor backgrounds who later made it.

I noticed a pattern - people who started rough but made it. This built at the back of my mind that there is a future where things will get better. However, I knew it wouldn't be handed to me on a platter of gold.

The future I want is where things are beautiful, where there's money, where we're living happily... This fueled a passion in me that whatever it takes, I'd put all my energy and strength.

I knew I couldn't continue like that. If I was going to do something beautiful, make it, or become rich, I had to do something. I just knew it.

So anything I found myself doing, I'd do it with everything I had. When people saw me doing something, they could see the passion, the energy... From my early young age, when I was sixteen, seventeen, I did everything with passion. I had to be successful, and I had to put everything into it. his realisation shaped my actions in such a way that the little things I was doing, I was doing them so passionately. As of that time when I had this mindset shift, I didn't know much about what to do.

However, the little things I was doing... for example, I started attending a new church and noticed they didn't have anyone who played the conga drum. I volunteered to play the conga - I had played in my former church and played it so well that during service, people put money in my pocket, gave me kudos, and celebrated my skill.

I played with all my strength and energy, as if my life depended on it - my hand would swell when I played.

In my new church, everyone started asking who this new boy playing so passionately was, and they appreciated me.

This mindset shift affected how committed I was. I started going to church every day to learn how to play the drums during the week - Monday to Friday, every day.

Since I was still young, I thought these things were what I needed to do to be successful, so I did it passionately. This made me consistent and disciplined.  When it comes to student leadership, my exposure also contributed to my success as a student leader. While I was growing up, when I wanted to go to secondary school, my elder sister who was in FUNAAB (Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta) volunteered to take me in. I stayed with her while she was in university and I went to my secondary school.

Fortunately, she was the class rep for her level in her department. As class rep, she'd tell me about her responsibilities, assignments, and interesting activities... and I admired that. I wanted to hold that kind of position.

A point came when one of our friends contested for faculty presidency. I knew the friend very well - we'd talk, gist... My sister would come back home tired, telling me about how the election process was stressful  "I was interested in this political position because it was interesting the way they'd come back and tell me about rallies, campaigns... they'd gist me about it.

My sister's friend won the election, but there was drama - the person who wrote a petition against another candidate got them disqualified. The disqualified candidate's people were angry and started campaigning against my sister's friend, saying a neutral person would win instead.

But the disqualified candidate mobilized his people to vote for my sister's friend (who wasn't popular), saying he'd been unfairly treated.

Hearing all this was interesting to me as a young person. I thought, "When I gain admission, I'm going to go into student politics, contest for positions"... so it prepared my mindset.

When I gained admission, it was easier because I already had that mindset - I was going to try it because it was interesting." 
The mindset shift is critical and one of the most important parts when it comes to leadership. Leading yourself is key.

People have assumed leadership is about leading others, directing people... neglecting the fact that leadership first is about YOU leading yourself. Leadership starts from you.

It's about the mindset that governs a leader. My success today is attributed to the fact that I lead myself. I can trace it back to that part of me that started with the mindset of becoming successful.

Leadership is first you must lead yourself before you can lead other people. For you to lead yourself, you must have the genuine mindset that'll push you to lead yourself."

How's that? Want me to refine it or continue? 😊

Got it 😊. Here's a typed-out version of your message:

"Mindset is so important if anyone wants to lead himself. A point has to come where you make up your mind that you will be in charge of your life.

I see so many people just living their life on autopilot... that self-realization must be there, the mindset must be there - the mindset of "now I can do these things".

One of the most critical points of my life was when I was scrolling online... I saw a competition flyer: if you can sing, do spoken words, dance... you can win money. I said to myself, "I can do spoken words, let me give this competition a trial".

Prior to that, I'd never faced an audience, never put thoughts together to render spoken words, never spoken publicly... never done anything involving speaking to an audience.

But I said to myself I want to go for a competition of over five thousand people... and I said to myself, "I want to go and I will do it". This point marked a critical point in my life."

How's that? Want me to refine it or ask more questions about this? 😊

Got it 😊. Here's a typed-out version of your message:

"This competition is so big that participants are coming from every part of the country - from Lagos, from Ibadan, from Akure... and here I am in my small town telling myself I can do this.

I later went for the competition, I didn't even pass the audition stage... but the main point is that I said to myself, "I can go, I can render spoken words, I can do this thing".

That mindset... I trace it, it was that thought that shifted something in me. It was that thought that pushed me to start taking steps, to start going outside my comfort zone.

Because now that I have made up my mind that I want to do this thing, it means that if my mindset is aligned and I'm focused and I kept on repeating to myself... then every part of my body starts adjusting and starts working towards that goal."

How's that? Want me to refine it or ask more questions about this? 😊fg

Got it 😊. Here's af typed-out version of your message:

"And this has made me realize that if anybody, any individual has the right mindset first to do something - especially to lead his own life the way he is supposed to live... and start thinking positively.

The life you want to live, you're picturing it and you're adjusting your mindset that "this life I want is possible". Your mindset is shifting from "I can't do this thing" to "I can do it".

You start seeing possibilities in greatness. It starts with your mindset. If your mindset is right, every other thing will be falling in place.

The first and most important thing is your mindset. You have to have the right mindset leading your life. Even if you can't lead yourself, you can't lead others. You have to accept that truth."
