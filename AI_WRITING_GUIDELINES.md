# AI Writing Guidelines & Book Context

**Book Title:** *Leading from Within: Mastering Self to Impact Others*

## 📖 Book Overview
The core philosophy of this book is that **true leadership begins with self-leadership**. Before one can effectively lead others, organizations, or movements, one must first master their own discipline, purpose, and mindset. The narrative traces the author's journey—from pre-university decisions to student leadership and entrepreneurship—using personal anecdotes to illustrate universal leadership principles.

## 🎯 Target Audience & Standards
*   **Audience:** Global/International.
*   **Standard:** High-quality non-fiction, suitable for international publication.
*   **Tone:** Inspiring, authoritative yet relatable, reflective, and professional.
*   **Context:** While the author's experiences are rooted in specific local contexts (e.g., Nigerian university system), the lessons **must be framed universally**.
    *   *Instruction:* When local terms or situations arise, contextualize them so an international reader understands the significance without feeling alienated.

## 🤖 Instructions for the AI
The author will provide raw, unstructured content ("thoughts as they come"). Your task is to process this input using the following rules:

### 1. Structure & Flow
*   **Chronological Arrangement:** The author's raw input may jump between timelines. You must rearrange these thoughts into a logical, chronological sequence within the chapter.
*   **Logical Progression:** Ensure that ideas flow smoothly from one to the next. Connect isolated thoughts into a cohesive narrative.

### 2. Editing & Refinement
*   **Grammar & Syntax:** Fix all grammatical errors and improve sentence structure.
*   **International Standard:** Elevate the vocabulary and phrasing to meet global publishing standards. Avoid colloquialisms unless they are deliberate and explained.
*   **Maintain Originality:** **CRITICAL.** Do not sanitize the text to the point where it sounds robotic or generic. Preserve the author's unique voice, passion, and perspective. The goal is to polish, not rewrite the personality out of the book.

### 3. Content Goals
*   **Focus:** Ensure every section reinforces the central theme: *Self-Leadership is the prerequisite for Public Leadership*.
*   **Actionable Insights:** Where possible, help crystallize the author's experiences into actionable takeaways for the reader.

### 4. Enhancements & Interactive Feedback
*   **Suggest Quotes:** Proactively suggest relevant quotes from historical figures, business leaders, or philosophers that reinforce the point being made.
*   **Request Clarification:** If a story or concept is vague, incomplete, or confusing, explicitly ask the author for more details or context before finalizing that section.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** Since the book is story-driven, ensure the reader knows *what to do* with the inspiration. Identify or create distinct "Action Points" or "Reflective Questions" at the end of key sections to bridge the gap between the author's story and the reader's life.
